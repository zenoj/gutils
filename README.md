# golang-utils
-> A utility package aimed at performance and as an extension to the standard library.
  
The benchmarks folder discusses the solutions and shows why things are the way they are.

The concurrent package includes examples where parallelism can save some time with these tasks.
Most of the time these solutions are not faster, just if we need more computation power.
